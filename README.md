## How Scopely Monopoly Go Works

Monopoly Go is an exciting digital rendition of the traditional Monopoly game. Players roll dice to move around the board and acquire properties, which they can buy, sell, or trade with other players. The game is designed to mimic the familiar rules and strategies of the board game while incorporating new elements, such as special cards and events that add variety to gameplay.

## Why Free Dice Matter in Monopoly Go

Dice are the core mechanic of Monopoly Go, determining how far players move and which properties they land on. However, acquiring dice can be a bit tricky. While players can purchase dice with real money or in-game currency, many prefer to find ways to obtain them for free to avoid spending additional money on a mobile game.

In the following sections, we will explore different methods you can use to earn free dice in Monopoly Go, and discuss which ones are most effective.

### Methods to Get Free Dice in Monopoly Go

#### 1. Daily Bonuses and Login Rewards
One of the easiest ways to get free dice in Monopoly Go is by logging in daily to claim your login bonuses. The game offers rewards for consecutive days of logging in, and these rewards often include free dice rolls. 

#### 2. Special Events
Scopely frequently holds special in-game events where players can earn additional rewards, including free dice. These events often feature tasks or challenges that, when completed, will reward you with dice rolls or other useful items. 

#### 3. Watching Ads
Another way to earn free dice in Monopoly Go is by watching ads. Players can opt to watch a short advertisement in exchange for free dice. This method doesnâ€™t require any additional downloads or purchases and is a simple way to earn extra rolls.

#### 4. Free Dice Hacks and Cheats
Some players seek out hacks or cheats to get unlimited free dice in Monopoly Go. While these methods might seem tempting, itâ€™s important to exercise caution. Many hacks involve third-party apps or websites that can compromise the security of your device or account. Always prioritize legitimate methods to avoid risking your account.

#### 5. Inviting Friends
In Monopoly Go, referring friends can be a rewarding experience. If you invite friends to join the game using your referral link, both you and your friend might receive free dice as a reward. This is a great way to expand your network while also earning some extra rolls.

#### 6. Completing Achievements and Milestones
Monopoly Go has built-in achievements and milestones that players can complete for rewards. Reaching these milestones often rewards you with free dice, among other things like coins or boosters. Keep an eye on your progress and focus on completing these achievements to maximize your rewards.

#### 7. Social Media Contests and Giveaways
Occasionally, Scopely hosts social media contests or giveaways where players can win free dice. These promotions are typically announced on the gameâ€™s official social media pages, so be sure to follow them to stay updated on potential opportunities.

### Is Using Free Dice Safe?

While using legitimate methods to earn free dice in Monopoly Go is completely safe, players should avoid using third-party tools or websites offering cheats. These can lead to compromised accounts or even bans from the game. Stick to the in-game methods provided by Scopely to ensure your account stays secure.

## Maximizing Your Dice Rolls in Monopoly Go

Once youâ€™ve acquired free dice, youâ€™ll want to use them strategically. Here are some tips to help you maximize your dice rolls:

#### Plan Ahead
Before you roll, take a moment to assess the board. Plan your moves carefully to land on properties you want or avoid paying rent to opponents. This strategic thinking will help you make the most out of each roll.

#### Upgrade Your Properties
Owning properties is key to dominating in Monopoly Go. Once you have a set of properties, upgrade them to increase the rent others pay when they land on them. This can significantly increase your earnings, making it easier to buy more properties and continue progressing in the game.

#### Participate in Events
Donâ€™t just sit idle between rolls. Participate in special events and complete missions to earn more rewards, including free dice. The more active you are in the game, the more opportunities youâ€™ll have to earn free resources.

#### Trade Strategically
In Monopoly Go, trading is a powerful tool. Use your dice rolls to land on spaces where you can acquire properties you need. Once youâ€™ve acquired a valuable property, trade it with other players for properties that can help you complete a set and increase your potential for collecting rent.

### Common Problems with Free Dice

While free dice can significantly improve your gameplay, there are some common problems players may encounter:

#### Limited Availability of Free Dice
Some players find that free dice are limited, especially if theyâ€™re relying on ads or special events. This can make it difficult to progress quickly in the game without spending money.

#### Not Receiving Dice After Watching Ads
Occasionally, players may experience issues where they watch an ad but donâ€™t receive the promised dice. If this happens, try restarting the game or checking for any updates. If the problem persists, contact Scopelyâ€™s support team.

#### Account Bans from Using Cheats
As mentioned earlier, using hacks or third-party cheats to obtain free dice can lead to account bans. Itâ€™s crucial to avoid these methods to prevent losing your account and progress in the game.
